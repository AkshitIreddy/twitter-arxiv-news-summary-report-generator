Overview. ObjectFolder models the multisensory behaviors of real objects with 1) ObjectFolder 2.0, a dataset of 1,000 neural objects in the form of implicit neural representations with simulated multisensory data, and 2) ObjectFolder Real, a dataset that contains the multisensory measurements for 100 real-world household objects, building upon a newly designed pipeline for collecting the 3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, and tactile readings of real-world objects. It also contains a standard benchmark suite of 10 tasks for multisensory object-centric learning, centered around object recognition, reconstruction, and manipulation with sight, sound, and touch. We open source both datasets and the benchmark suite to catalyze and enable new research in multisensory object-centric learning in computer vision, robotics, and beyond. ObjectFolder Datasets ObjectFolder-Real 100 real-world household objects. A tailored data collection pipeline for each modality. For vision, we scan the 3D meshes of objects in a dark room and record HD videos of each object rotating in a lightbox. For audio, we build a professional anechoic chamber with a tailored object platform and then collect impact sounds by striking the objects at different surface locations with an impact hammer. For touch, we equip a Franka Emika Panda robot arm with a GelSight robotic finger and collect tactile readings at the exact surface locations where impact sounds are collected. Explore ObjectFolder-Real ObjectFolder 2.0 1,000 multisensory neural objects. Each neural object is represented by an Object File, a compact neural network that encodes the object's intrinsic visual, acoustic, and tactile sensory data.
